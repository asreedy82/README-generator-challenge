  ## Installation

  To use this application, start in your terminal from the folder where your project is located. Depending on the js file that is used to write the new README file, you'll need to type node file_name.js in terminal. For example, in my project the file that contains the function to write the README is called 'index.js' so I will type 'node index.js' into terminal. Then simply respond to each of the questions and when you finish the new README will show up in your folder.

  ## Usage

  The project is meant to help a developer create a professional looking README in a formulaic way so as to cover off on all the important sections of a good README. It also uses proper markdown language to ensure it looks good when viewing in GitHub.
